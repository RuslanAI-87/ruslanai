# WebSocket Connection Fix

## Problem

The RuslanAI system was experiencing issues with WebSocket connections being closed prematurely.
This resulted in notifications not being delivered to clients and tasks appearing to hang with
"Processing your request..." displayed indefinitely.

The specific error in the logs was:
`
Unexpected ASGI message 'websocket.send', after sending 'websocket.close' or response already completed.
`

## Solution

This fix addresses WebSocket connection stability through several components:

### 1. Client-Side Improvements

- **Enhanced WebSocket Service**:
  - Added keep-alive mechanism (ping messages every 30 seconds)
  - Improved reconnection logic with exponential backoff
  - Added message queueing for offline periods
  - Better connection state handling

- **Improved Agent Service**:
  - Added retry logic for failed API calls
  - Added proper error handling
  - Added connection verification before operations

### 2. Server-Side Improvements

- **Enhanced ConnectionManager**:
  - Added message buffering for disconnected clients
  - Improved connection state verification
  - Better error handling

- **WebSocket Endpoint Enhancements**:
  - Added ping-pong handling for keep-alive
  - Improved error handling
  - Better connection cleanup

## Usage

1. Use the desktop shortcut "RuslanAI_Fixed" to start the system
2. The system will start both API server and web UI with WebSocket fixes
3. WebSocket connections will now remain stable even during periods of inactivity

## Diagnostics

If you encounter any issues:

1. Run the diagnostics tool:
   `javascript
   // In browser console on RuslanAI page
   fetch('/websocket_diagnostics.js').then(r => r.text()).then(eval);
   `
