# WebSocket Connection Stability Issue in RuslanAI

## Problem Description

RuslanAI's web interface has been experiencing issues with WebSocket connections being closed prematurely, resulting in notifications not being delivered to the client. When a user sends a message in the chat, the system shows "Processing your request..." but never receives the response.

The API server logs show this specific error:
```
ERROR: Ошибка отправки уведомления клиенту user_h4riheyi4u6: Unexpected ASGI message 'websocket.send', after sending 'websocket.close' or response already completed.
```

This occurs when the server tries to send task notifications to a client that has disconnected.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Premature Connection Closing**: The WebSocket connection is being closed before task completion notifications are sent back to the client.

2. **Missing Keep-Alive Mechanism**: The WebSocket connection doesn't have a proper keep-alive mechanism, allowing the connection to be closed due to inactivity.

3. **Poor Reconnection Handling**: When a connection is lost, the system doesn't properly reconnect and synchronize the state of in-progress tasks.

4. **No Message Queuing**: Messages that fail to send due to connection issues are lost rather than being queued for retry once connection is reestablished.

5. **Connection State Inconsistency**: The server thinks the client is still connected when it's not, and vice versa.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced WebSocket Service (`websocketService.js`)

- **Keep-Alive Mechanism**: Added ping/pong message exchange every 30 seconds to keep the connection alive.
- **Message Queuing**: Messages sent during disconnected periods are stored and resent when the connection is reestablished.
- **Connection State Management**: Added proper connection state tracking with events to notify components of changes.
- **Robust Reconnection Logic**: Added exponential backoff for reconnection attempts and better error handling.
- **Task Tracking**: Added tracking of in-progress tasks to ensure notifications are properly handled.
- **Health Check**: Added a periodic health check to detect and fix "zombie" connections.

### 2. Improved RuslanAI Component (`RuslanAI.jsx`)

- **Connection State Awareness**: Added UI updates based on connection state changes.
- **Visual Reconnection Indicators**: Added visual indicators when reconnecting.
- **Manual Reconnect Button**: Added a button to allow users to manually trigger reconnection.
- **Enhanced Send Message Handler**: Updated to check connection state before sending and handle reconnection scenarios.

### 3. Enhanced Agent Service (`agentService.js`)

- **Retry Logic**: Added retry capability for failed API calls.
- **Timeout Handling**: Added request timeouts to prevent hanging requests.
- **WebSocket Connection Verification**: Added checks to ensure WebSocket is connected when needed.

## Technical Implementation Details

### WebSocket Keep-Alive Mechanism

```javascript
// Keep connection alive with ping messages
startKeepAlive() {
  this.stopKeepAlive(); // Clear any existing interval
  
  this.pingInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (this.socket && this.socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      console.log('Sending ping to keep connection alive');
      this.sendMessage({ type: 'ping', timestamp: Date.now() });
    } else {
      console.warn('Cannot send ping - socket not open');
      // Connection might be closed unexpectedly, try reconnecting
      if (this.connectionState === 'connected') {
        console.warn('Socket not open but state is connected - reconnecting');
        this.connectionState = 'disconnected';
        this.connect();
      }
    }
  }, 30000); // Send ping every 30 seconds
}
```

### Message Queuing System

```javascript
// Queue message for later sending when connection is restored
queueMessage(message) {
  // Limit queue size to prevent memory issues
  if (this.messageQueue.length < 50) {
    console.log('Message queued for later sending:', message);
    this.messageQueue.push({
      message,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  } else {
    console.warn('Message queue full, dropping oldest message');
    this.messageQueue.shift(); // Remove oldest message
    this.messageQueue.push({
      message,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }
}

// Process queued messages when connection is restored
processMessageQueue() {
  if (this.messageQueue.length === 0) return;
  
  console.log(`Processing ${this.messageQueue.length} queued messages`);
  
  // Process messages older than 5 minutes first
  const now = Date.now();
  const fiveMinutes = 5 * 60 * 1000;
  const oldMessages = this.messageQueue.filter(item => now - item.timestamp > fiveMinutes);
  const recentMessages = this.messageQueue.filter(item => now - item.timestamp <= fiveMinutes);
  
  // Clear queue
  this.messageQueue = [];
  
  // Send recent messages
  recentMessages.forEach(item => {
    console.log('Sending queued message:', item.message);
    this.sendMessage(item.message);
  });
  
  // Log messages that were too old
  if (oldMessages.length > 0) {
    console.log(`${oldMessages.length} messages were too old and were dropped`);
  }
}
```

### Connection State Management

```javascript
// Notify listeners of connection state changes
notifyConnectionStateChange(state) {
  if (this.typeSpecificCallbacks.has('connection-state')) {
    const callbacks = this.typeSpecificCallbacks.get('connection-state');
    callbacks.forEach(callback => {
      try {
        callback({ state, reconnectAttempt: this.reconnectAttempts, error: this.lastConnectionError });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error in connection state callback:', error);
      }
    });
  }
}
```

## Server-Side Considerations

While these client-side changes significantly improve WebSocket stability, additional server-side improvements should be considered:

1. **Longer WebSocket Timeouts**: Increase the timeout values on the server to prevent premature connection closing.

2. **Ping/Pong Handler**: Ensure the server properly responds to ping messages with pong messages.

3. **Connection State Cleanup**: Implement a cleanup mechanism to properly release resources for disconnected clients.

4. **Task-to-Client Mapping**: Improve the mapping between tasks and clients to handle reconnection scenarios better.

## How to Apply This Fix

1. Run the `update_websocket_stability.ps1` script:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\RuslanAI\scripts\update_websocket_stability.ps1
   ```

2. Restart the RuslanAI web interface and API server.

3. Use the "Run_RuslanAI_Stable.lnk" shortcut to launch the system with enhanced WebSocket stability.

## Verification

After applying these changes, verify that:

1. WebSocket connections remain stable for extended periods.
2. Chat messages receive responses correctly.
3. If you disconnect and reconnect, pending tasks continue to update.
4. Ping messages are being sent every 30 seconds and the server responds.

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check the browser console for WebSocket-related errors.
2. Review the API server logs for connection errors.
3. Verify that the ping/pong messages are being exchanged correctly.
4. Ensure that the API server is responding to the WebSocket endpoint correctly.

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the stability of WebSocket connections in RuslanAI, ensuring that notifications are delivered reliably and the user experience remains smooth even in the face of temporary connection issues.
