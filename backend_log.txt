Due to a bug fix in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/28687 transcription using a multilingual Whisper will default to language detection followed by transcription instead of translation to English.This might be a breaking change for your use case. If you want to instead always translate your audio to English, make sure to pass `language='en'`.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
