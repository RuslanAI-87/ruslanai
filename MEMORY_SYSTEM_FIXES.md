# Memory System Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the RuslanAI memory system.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate Encoding Headers**
   - Removed triplicate `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` headers
   - Removed redundant import statements
   - Kept only a single clean encoding header in each file

2. **Encoding Issues**
   - Fixed UTF-8 handling for console output
   - Ensured proper encoding in log files
   - Created a clean startup script with proper encoding settings

3. **Stream Redirection Problems**
   - Fixed multiple `sys.stdout` redirections that caused I/O errors
   - Ensured only one redirection is active at a time
   - Added proper error handling for I/O operations

4. **Language Uniformity**
   - Translated all Russian comments and log messages to English
   - Ensured consistent naming conventions throughout the code
   - Maintained original functionality while improving readability

## Files Modified

1. `/mnt/c/RuslanAI/central_agent/modules/memory/memory_system.py`
   - Complete rewrite with clean encoding
   - Translated all messages and comments to English
   - Fixed stream redirection issues

2. `/mnt/c/RuslanAI/central_agent/modules/memory/vector_store.py`
   - Removed duplicate headers and imports
   - Translated all Russian comments and messages
   - Preserved full functionality including GPU acceleration

3. `/mnt/c/RuslanAI/central_agent/backend/direct_api.py`
   - Translated all messages and comments to English
   - Fixed potential encoding issues in API responses

## New Files Created

1. `/mnt/c/RuslanAI/restart_api.bat`
   - Clean script to start the API with proper encoding
   - Automatically installs dependencies if missing
   - Sets correct environment variables for UTF-8

2. `/mnt/c/RuslanAI/MEMORY_SYSTEM.md`
   - Documentation explaining the memory system architecture
   - Overview of hierarchical memory and vector storage
   - Troubleshooting guidance for common issues

## How to Verify Fixes

1. Use the `restart_api.bat` script to start the API server
2. Check logs in `C:/RuslanAI/logs/` for any remaining errors
3. Send test requests to the API and observe that context is maintained
4. Verify that no "Vector storage unavailable" warnings appear in logs

The system should now operate with proper vector storage, maintaining conversation context between messages without encoding issues or I/O errors.
