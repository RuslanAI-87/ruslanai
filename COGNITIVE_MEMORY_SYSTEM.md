# Cognitive Memory System

This document provides an overview of the Cognitive Memory System implemented for RuslanAI.

## Architecture Overview

The Cognitive Memory System is a sophisticated, hierarchical memory architecture with cognitive capabilities for enhanced context retention, knowledge management, and performance optimization.

### Key Components

1. **Enhanced Hierarchical Memory**
   - Four-level memory hierarchy:
     - **Operational Memory**: For immediate context and active dialog (~3-5 turns)
     - **Working Memory**: For recent and contextually relevant information (hours to days)
     - **Long-term Memory**: For persistent knowledge (weeks to months)
     - **Meta-memory**: For self-reflection and system optimization

2. **Cognitive Layers**
   - **Attention Layer**: Evaluates information importance and routes queries
   - **Consistency Layer**: Detects contradictions and ensures data integrity
   - **Compression Layer**: Summarizes and compresses information for efficient storage

3. **Memory Agent**
   - Audits memory system performance
   - Optimizes memory operations
   - Generates recommendations for improvement
   - Applies safe optimizations automatically

4. **Integration Adapter**
   - Ensures backward compatibility with existing systems
   - Provides unified API for memory operations
   - Gracefully degrades when components are unavailable

## Performance Optimization

The Cognitive Memory System incorporates several optimizations:

1. **Vector Storage with HNSW Indexing**
   - Uses Milvus with HNSW algorithm for fast similarity search
   - Scales efficiently to large datasets

2. **Incremental Search Strategy**
   - Checks memory levels sequentially from fastest to slowest
   - Returns early when sufficient results are found

3. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Background tasks for compression and consolidation
   - Non-blocking memory operations

4. **Adaptive Memory Management**
   - Automatic transfer of items between memory levels based on usage patterns
   - Memory importance re-evaluation over time

## Integration with Orchestrator

The Cognitive Memory System integrates with the Central Orchestrator through a dedicated integration module that:

1. Patches the orchestrator's methods to use cognitive memory
2. Provides seamless dialog restoration across sessions
3. Maintains backward compatibility with traditional memory
4. Handles graceful degradation when components are unavailable

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the orchestrator with cognitive memory
from central_orchestrator import CentralOrchestrator
from cognitive_memory_integration import update_orchestrator_memory_system

# Create orchestrator instance
orchestrator = CentralOrchestrator()

# Update with cognitive memory
orchestrator = update_orchestrator_memory_system(orchestrator, api_key="your_api_key")

# Use orchestrator as usual
response = orchestrator.start_session("Hello, I'm a user", chat_id="user123")
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Context Retention**: Maintains dialog context across sessions more effectively
2. **Enhanced Performance**: Faster retrievals for large knowledge bases
3. **Dynamic Optimization**: Self-optimizes based on usage patterns
4. **Cognitive Processing**: Evaluates importance, ensures consistency, and compresses information intelligently

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- SentenceTransformers
- Milvus (optional, for vector storage)
- GPU acceleration (optional, for faster embeddings)
